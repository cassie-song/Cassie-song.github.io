    <h3>2015 GoogleServe at San Jose Heritage House</h3>
    <p>Every year Google has a GoogleServe week to encourage employees to work with local NGOs/NPOs to contribute back to local communities. I have participated in every GoogleServe since I joined Google in 2012. For example, in 2014, I helped build a bike trail in Saratoga Sanborn County Park to bring a safe route to the Bay Area cyclists. In 2015, I joined the project on renovating the garden area of San Jose Heritage House to bring a better environment to Moms and babies in the Heritage House.</p>

    <h3>2011 Visiting Student at MIT</h3>
    <p>In addition to do research on commonsense knowledge, I also participated in several activities when I was a visiting student at MIT. Every Wednesday, I attended <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/" target="_blank">Prof. Marvin Minsky</a>'s (in the photo) class <i>The Emotion Machine</i> and had many good discussions with him about intelligence and cognitive AI in the class. I also presented applications powered by commonsense knowledge in Media Lab Sponsor Week. I was later invited to <a href="http://global.hisense.com/" target="_blank">Hisense</a>'s National Research Lab in Qingdao, China to give an in-depth tutorial on how to build voice interface with commonsense knowledge.</p>

    <h3>2008 Nightmarket Workshop at Tainan</h3>
    <p>The Nightmarket Workshop was the first event I joined which brings people with art, design, and technology background together. In the 5-day workshop, I worked with <a href="http://marisajahn.com/" target="_blank">Marisa Jahn</a> and <a href="http://www.pan-o-matic.com/" target="_blank">Stephanie Rothenberg</a>, and other teammates (in the photo) to create participatory art installation to bring up awareness of food safety and genetic modified food to general public.</p>
    <p>The idea of this installation stemmed from the concern that in many places, people did not pay much attention to the sources of food and the problems of genetic modified food when they make purchase decision. In this work, we "invented" new fruits like zebra orange and monkey kiwi and sold them in nightmarkets in Tainan, Taiwan to bring up people's attention to this issue.</p>
